- Computer (`Client`) inputs the correct credentials where the service is located: `IP` and `PORT`.
- `Client` will attempt to coneect to server

When connection is established

- `Client` can send messages
- `Server` can receive messages
- `Server` can send messages back to `Client`
- `Client` can receive messages

## HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

- `Client` makes a `REQUEST` to `Server`
- Connection gets established
- `Server` sends back a `RESPONSE`
